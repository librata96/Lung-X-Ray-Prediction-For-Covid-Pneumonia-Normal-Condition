# Lung X Ray Prediction for Covid Pneumonia Normal Condition

This Project goals it to predict whether someone has COVID-19 or pneumonia using Convolutinal Neural Network
After that, deploy the deep learning model using Streamlit and Hugging Face platform For online usage.

## Tools
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Streamlit
- Hugging Face
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Deployment
You can make the prediction here [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/barentz96/Lung-XRay-Prediction)
